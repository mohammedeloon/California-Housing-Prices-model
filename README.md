# California-Housing-Prices-model
A prediction of a district’s median housing price
## Frame the Big Picture
This model learns from the dataset provided and predicts the median housing price of each block group in California, based on many other features.
The output of this ML model will be fed to another ML system with other signals. Finally, the downstream system will decide whether or not it is
worth investing in a given area.
Note: geting this right is critical as it directly affects the revenue.
